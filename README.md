## Hi there 👋

## Hi there! 👋

I'm Aysha Ansari, currently navigating the wild world of BTech IT in college. Yes, I am a beginner, but hey, every expert was once a newbie who didn't know how to exit Vim! 😅

### About Me

- 🌱 **Learning:** How to code, debug, and survive on instant noodles.
- 💻 **Course:** BTech Information Technology (IT)
- 🤓 **Skills:** Googling error messages like a pro.
- 🧑‍� **Projects:** Mostly trying to get my code to run without crying.
- � **Fun Fact:** I believe coffee and Ctrl+Z can fix almost anything.

### What am I doing here?

Documenting my journey from "What is Git?" to "I think I broke production..."

Feel free to connect, collaborate, or just send memes. Let's learn together!
